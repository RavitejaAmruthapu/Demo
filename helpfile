       FORMAT controls the output.  Interpreted sequences are:

       %B     locale's full month name (e.g., January)

       %c     locale's date and time (e.g., Thu Mar  3 23:05:25 2005)

       %k     hour, space padded ( 0..23); same as %_H

       %l     hour, space padded ( 1..12); same as %_I

       %m     month (01..12)

       %M     minute (00..59)

       %n     a newline

       %N     nanoseconds (000000000..999999999)

       %t     a tab

       %T     time; same as %H:%M:%S

       %V     ISO week number, with Monday as first day of week (01..53)

       %w     day of week (0..6); 0 is Sunday

       %W     week number of year, with Monday as first day of week (00..53)

       %x     locale's date representation (e.g., 12/31/99)

       %::z   +hh:mm:ss numeric time zone (e.g., -04:00:00)

       %:::z  numeric time zone with : to necessary precision (e.g., -04, +05:30)

       %Z     alphabetic time zone abbreviation (e.g., EDT)

       By  default, date pads numeric fields with zeroes.  The following optional
       flags may follow '%':

       -      (hyphen) do not pad the field

       _      (underscore) pad with spaces

       0      (zero) pad with zeros

       ^      use upper case if possible

       #      use opposite case if possible

       After any flags comes an optional field width, as a decimal  number;  then
       an optional modifier, which is either E to use the locale's alternate rep‐
       resentations if available, or O to use the locale's alternate numeric sym‐
       bols if available.

ENVIRONMENT
       TZ     Specifies  the  timezone, unless overridden by command line parame‐
              ters.  If neither is specified, the setting from /etc/localtime  is
              used.

EXAMPLES
       Convert seconds since the epoch (1970-01-01 UTC) to a date

              $ date --date='@2147483647'

       Show the time on the west coast of the US (use tzselect(1) to find TZ)

              $ TZ='America/Los_Angeles' date

       Show the local time for 9AM next Friday on the west coast of the US

              $ date --date='TZ="America/Los_Angeles" 09:00 next Fri'

DATE STRING
       The --date=STRING is a mostly free format human readable date string  such
       as  "Sun,  29  Feb  2004  16:21:42 -0800" or "2004-02-29 16:21:42" or even
       "next Thursday".  A date string  may  contain  items  indicating  calendar
       date,  time  of day, time zone, day of week, relative time, relative date,
       and numbers.  An empty string indicates the beginning  of  the  day.   The
       date  string  format is more complex than is easily documented here but is
       fully described in the info documentation.

NAME
       cal - display a calendar

SYNOPSIS
       cal [options] [[[day] month] year]

DESCRIPTION
       cal  displays  a simple calendar.  If no arguments are specified, the cur‐
       rent month is displayed.

OPTIONS
       -1, --one
              Display single month output.  (This is the default.)

       -3, --three
              Display prev/current/next month output.

       -s, --sunday
              Display Sunday as the first day of the week.

       -m, --monday
              Display Monday as the first day of the week.

       -j, --julian
              Display Julian dates (days one-based, numbered from January 1).

       -y, --year
              Display a calendar for the current year.

       -V, --version
              Display version information and exit.

       -h, --help
              Display help screen and exit.

PARAMETERS
       A single parameter specifies the year (1 - 9999) to be displayed; note the
       year must be fully specified: cal 89 will not display a calendar for 1989.

       Two parameters denote the month (1 - 12) and year.

       Three  parameters  denote the day (1-31), month and year, and the day will
       be highlighted if the calendar is displayed on a terminal. If  no  parame‐
       ters are specified, the current month's calendar is displayed.

       A  year  starts  on  Jan 1. The first day of the week is determined by the
       locale.

       The Gregorian Reformation is assumed to have occurred in 1752 on  the  3rd
       of  September. By this time, most countries had recognized the reformation
       (although a few did not recognize it until the  early  1900's).  Ten  days
       following  that  date  were eliminated by the reformation, so the calendar
       for that month is a bit unusual.

HISTORY
       A cal command appeared in Version 6 AT&T UNIX.

AVAILABILITY
       The cal command is part of the util-linux package and  is  available  from
       ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux/.

NAME
       touch - change file timestamps

SYNOPSIS
       touch [OPTION]... FILE...

DESCRIPTION
       Update the access and modification times of each FILE to the current time.

       A  FILE  argument that does not exist is created empty, unless -c or -h is
       supplied.

       A FILE argument string of - is  handled  specially  and  causes  touch  to
       change the times of the file associated with standard output.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -a     change only the access time

       -c, --no-create
              do not create any files

       -d, --date=STRING
              parse STRING and use it instead of current time

       -f     (ignored)

       -h, --no-dereference
              affect  each  symbolic  link instead of any referenced file (useful
              only on systems that can change the timestamps of a symlink)

       -m     change only the modification time

       -r, --reference=FILE
              use this file's times instead of current time

       -t STAMP
              use [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.ss] instead of current time

       --time=WORD
              change the specified time: WORD is access, atime, or  use:  equiva‐
              lent to -a WORD is modify or mtime: equivalent to -m

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       Note that the -d and -t options accept different time-date formats.
